[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Austin-Way/Afterschool1.git)

## üîß Configuration

The application uses a Claude AI API key for goal validation. The key is currently embedded in the server code for simplicity, but in production, it should be moved to environment variables.

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
PORT=3000
```

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Create an Account
- Click "Sign up" on the login page
- Enter your username, email, and password
- Click "Create Account"

### 2. Submit a Goal
- Enter your goal in the text area
- Be specific and measurable (e.g., "Complete 150 XP in Python programming challenges")
- If your goal involves XP, enter the amount and upload a screenshot of your current XP dashboard
- Click "Validate with AI" to check your goal

### 3. AI Validation
The AI will assess your goal based on:
- **Difficulty**: Must require at least 3 hours of work
- **Measurability**: Must have clear success criteria
- **Reasonableness**: Must be achievable but not trivial

### 4. Submit Your Goal
- If validation passes, click "Submit Goal"
- Your goal will appear in the "Your Goals" section
- Track your progress and mark goals as complete when finished

## üìã Goal Examples

### ‚úÖ Good Goals
- "Complete 150 XP in Python programming challenges" (with XP screenshot)
- "Send 12 personalized cold emails to potential clients with follow-up tracking"
- "Write and publish a 2000-word technical blog post with code examples"
- "Complete 5 LeetCode hard problems and document solutions"

### ‚ùì Goals That Trigger AI Questions
- "Add 500 words to brainlift" ‚Üí AI asks: "What is brainlift? What type of content?"
- "Complete 150 XP on CodeSignal" ‚Üí AI asks: "What is CodeSignal? What activities earn XP?"
- "Finish my project" ‚Üí AI asks: "What type of project? What does completion look like?"

### ‚ùå Poor Goals
- "Send 3 emails" (too easy, < 3 hours)
- "Do some coding" (not measurable)
- "Get better at programming" (not specific)
- "Complete 50 XP" (without screenshot, too easy)
